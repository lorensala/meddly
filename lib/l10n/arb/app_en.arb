    "sexWhyDescription": "    In our medical app, we only offer the option to select between \"Male\" and \"Female\" in the sex selection due to medical and practical reasons.\n   From a medical perspective, the binary classification of sex has historically been used in medicine because most diseases and conditions have a higher prevalence in one gender than the other. In addition, biological differences between males and females can influence how diseases are presented and treated.\n   For example, women have a higher risk of developing osteoporosis while men have a higher risk of coronary disease. Symptoms and the presentation of some diseases can also vary by gender. Therefore, having accurate information about a patient's sex can help doctors make a more accurate diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment.\n    Regarding practical reasons, limiting the options to \"Male\" and \"Female\" facilitates data collection and analysis. By having a binary classification, we can obtain more precise and useful information about the health of our users.\n    It's important to note that we understand that gender is a more complex and varied issue that can encompass a wider range of identities. However, in our medical app, we limit ourselves to offering these two options due to medical and practical reasons. We appreciate your understanding and are committed to providing high-quality and respectful medical care to all individuals who use our app.",
